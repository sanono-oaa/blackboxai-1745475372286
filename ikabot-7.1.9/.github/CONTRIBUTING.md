# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to the Ikabot project. Your engagement is essential, and we're committed to making the contribution process straightforward and transparent. Whether you're reporting a bug, discussing the current code, submitting a fix, proposing new features, or expressing interest in becoming a maintainer, your input is valued, and we anticipate a collaborative and positive contribution experience.

## General Contribution Guidelines

1.  **Lightweight Design Philosophy:** Ikabot prioritizes functionality over unnecessary features, following a lightweight design philosophy. Avoid changes that compromise the project's lightweight and efficient nature.
    
2.  **Dependency Management:** Limit the use of external dependencies, especially for cosmetic or non-essential features. Introduce new dependencies only if crucial for Ikabot's core functionality.
    
3.  **Python Version:** Utilize the latest Python versions to leverage language advancements. Ensure compatibility with recent Python releases when submitting contributions.
    
4.  **IDE Preference - Visual Studio Code:** While contributions from various IDEs are welcome, Visual Studio Code is the preferred choice for seamless integration.
    
5.  **Code Formatting - Black Formatter:** Maintain consistent and readable code using the [Black code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter). Ensure your code adheres to formatting standards before submitting a PR for better collaboration.
    

## Specific PR Guidelines

1.  **Size Matters:** Aim for smaller changes, keeping a single feature confined to a single branch/PR for a manageable scope.
    
2.  **Visual Insight - Screenshots:** Provide clarity through accompanying screenshots when introducing new features. Visuals assist both reviewers and users in understanding the functionality and potential impact of proposed changes.
    
3.  **Testing Terrain - Unit Tests:** While not obligatory, including unit tests in your PR is highly valued. Such tests contribute significantly to codebase stability and quality, ensuring resilient functionality.
    

## PR Rejection Information

If your PR is rejected, pay close attention to the feedback provided by project maintainers. Ensure your contributions align with the project's goals, especially regarding lightweight design and dependency management.

## Next Steps

If your PR has been closed, consider providing detailed documentation and explanations to help project maintainers understand the value of your changes. Your commitment to improving Ikabot is highly valued, and we encourage ongoing collaboration.
